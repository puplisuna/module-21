                   <strong>Hello and welcome! My name is Ohom Bhattacharjee, and I’m currently a student in Class 6. While I may be young, my <br>
                passion for coding is something that runs deep and grows stronger every day. I believe that age is no barrier to<br>
                creativity or innovation, and this portfolio is a reflection of my journey so far in the world of technology.<br>
                
                My adventure into coding began with block-based platforms like Scratch and Code.org, where I learned the basics of<br>
                programming logic and structure through fun and interactive projects. These platforms gave me the confidence to
                explore<br>
                more advanced tools and languages. Now, I actively work with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create real websites,
                design<br>
                user interfaces, and experiment with interactive elements on the web.<br>
                
                One of the things I love most about coding is the freedom it gives me to create anything I imagine—from colorful,<br>
                animated pages to small web-based games and tools. Every project teaches me something new, whether it’s how to
                structure<br>
                a website, how to make it look nice with CSS, or how to make it respond to user actions with JavaScript.<br>
                
                As a student, I’m constantly learning—not just in school, but also through online tutorials, coding challenges, and
                by<br>
                studying other developers’ work. I spend a lot of my free time exploring new ideas, solving coding puzzles, and
                building<br>
                small projects that help me practice what I’ve learned. I enjoy the process of debugging, refining, and improving my<br>
                work, and I never stop looking for ways to make my code cleaner and more effective.<br>
                
                My goal is to keep expanding my skills and eventually learn more advanced programming languages, like Python or C++,
                and<br>
                maybe even get into app or game development one day. I’m especially interested in creating things that are both
                useful<br>
                and fun, and I hope that someday my work will help or inspire others.<br>
                
                This portfolio is not just a collection of projects—it’s a story of my growth as a young developer. Here, you'll
                find<br>
                some of the things I’ve created, the technologies I’ve used, and the progress I’ve made as I continue to learn and<br>
                build. I hope you enjoy exploring my work as much as I’ve enjoyed creating it.<br>
                
                Thank you for visiting my website. I’m excited about the future, and this is just the beginning!<br></strong>
